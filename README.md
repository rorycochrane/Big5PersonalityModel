# Big5PersonalityModel

Work in progress

The [Big 5 Personality Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) is a grouping of personality traits based on survey data. For a more thorough introduction to the model, and to the particular set of survey data, see '1_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb'.

The goal of this project is to train simple machine learning models to predict the answers to Big 5 survey questions based on either the survey taker's demographic data or their answers to other Big 5 survey questions.
